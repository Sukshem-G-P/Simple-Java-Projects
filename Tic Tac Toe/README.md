Game Rules:<br>
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.<br>
There are two players: Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'.<br>
Players take turns to enter a number between 1 and 9 to place their symbol on the board:<br>
1 corresponds to the top-left corner,<br>
2 corresponds to the top-center,<br>
3 corresponds to the top-right corner,<br>
and so on until 9, which corresponds to the bottom-right corner.<br>
The first player to align three of their symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.<br>
If all 9 slots are filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game ends in a draw.<br>
